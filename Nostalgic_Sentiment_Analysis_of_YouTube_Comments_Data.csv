not nostalgia,"He was a singer with a golden voice that I love to hear all the time. I was his great fan at the age of 16years in those days and still now. Although we have many singers now, but, I can vouch for Jim Reeves all the time. You feel relaxed, emotional and loving. Thank you Lord for his life."
nostalgia,The mist beautiful voice ever I listened to him when I was a kid and still love his singing Never forgotten The voice of an angel
nostalgia,"I have most of Mr. Reeves songs.  Always love his smooth voice, so comforting and sounds like the people I grew up around.  They were so gentle and sweet, but I had to leave my little town to find a job at age 17.  I graduated early.  I never forgot how great it was to grow up with simple people who had no pretensions -- just loving and gentle, like I think Jesus is."
not nostalgia,"30 day leave from 1st tour in Viet Nam to convince my Mary Lou to ""marry me"" when I came back from my 2nd tour.  Now, 47 years later this December God granted the greatest blessing a man can receive.  This song is for the hope of life all who have served pray for and some are granted that hope to be reality. Thank you my Mary Lou."

I was presented albums of his songs by Mr. Eric (Australia) of which I guess I could sing along at least 100 songs by now! I heard him he's a boxer as well in his college years!

nostalgia,SO BEAUTIFUL. I GET GOOSEBUMPS.THIS REMINDS ME OF THE TIME WHEN I WAS LITTLE.MY DAD USED TO PLAY AND DANCE WITH MY MOM..MY MOM HAS PASSED AWAY.
nostalgia,"I remember as a small child in my grandparents house listening to these great songs being played from a beautiful Gramaphone, made of rose wood with the vacuum valves it was a piece of furniture in itself,  such a beautiful sound a tone that somehow cannot be replicated today Jim's voice suited it so well."

nostalgia,"If I remember correctly, this song came out after Mr. Reeves passed away. I was about 10 years old when the disc jockey said that the news just came over the wire that he died in a plane crash."
not nostalgia,"Someone says it' about a tom girl. That is a plausible interpretation, but I think it's about a boy whose three elder sisters and mother treat and  raise him as a girl. ""Put this wig on, little boy"". Great number, one of my very favorites by the Who."
not nostalgia,"When I was 4, I knew a boy who was brought up to think he was a girl. That was in the  early 1960s."
not nostalgia,They have so many great songs. But "I'm a Boy" is still one of my favorite.

not nostalgia,Oh dear.  Another of my mum's favorite Jim Reeves songs.  Takes on a different meaning now that she's gone.  She heard the sound of distant drums calling her away.  Tears now flowing.

nostalgia,Always reminds me of my granddad who liked listening to jim reeves and johnny cash.
not nostalgia,Such a brilliant song...it's like a mix of Motown & Barry White's Love Unlimited Orchestra. Reminds me of Robert Palmer too...would've been so nice if he had done a version of it.
nostalgia,"I remember this record very well and it makes me smile knowing I was lucky enough to live during this great era of beautifully written, produced and arranged music..The kind of music that was a real labor of love. And how sad it is to know we will never see it again.."

nostalgia,"Oh gosh just fell back to my youth... memories,  sweet memories. Loved it then and still love it. Tune!"

not nostalgia,I wish I lived in this song's generation.... I just prefer this than my generations music
nostalgia,My grandma really loved elvis ???s music .. so we played this song at her funeral .. everytime i listen to this Song there are so many memories in my head

not nostalgia,"I think when Princilla left him it all started to go wrong for him.  He loved her and Lisa Marie.  So sad!I wish he had been able to fulfill his life, he was a gentle soul."
nostalgia,"I ruined a relationship with the most beautiful, wonderful, loving woman ever. This song reminds me i should have been more transparent, i broke her heart. And i regret it 10 years later."
not nostalgia,So sad I never get to see him wish I was in the time of elvis Presley and Michael Jackson
not nostalgia,"Always was and always will be the greatest,always been my favorite singer..awesome what a loss he was to the world"
not nostalgia,I???m only 16 years old but I???ve always had people listen to him he???s amazing
not nostalgia,I grew up hard and never learned how to love and whenever I'm in a relationship I never told any of them that I loved them. I'm probably going to die alone because of the little things I can't say or do to show a woman I love her .
nostalgia,I love this song so much. I can still remember my mum Mary sat curled up on my fathers lap while he sung along to this song. He had the most amazing Welsh Singing voice and the loved they shared was so deep. I miss them both so much but I am glad they are still together.

nostalgia,"This song came out in 67, I was 5 yo. It was my favorite song then and my mom bought me the 45 record and I still have it.  The Motown sound is still alive and well in my memories."
not nostalgia,"The SOUL in his voice, and at such a young age he had so much vocal power. Seventeen years old, what a legend this man"
nostalgia,"I was 19 when this song came out, it brings back some good memories of that time."
not nostalgia,Who wrote this song? I think maybe Steve Winwood. He was only 17 as well. By the way Spencer Davis was a teacher at my old primary school for a while. My son now goes there.
not nostalgia,Someone said he's 16 years old there..hard to believe .but he's really good for that age.
not nostalgia,If I tried to sing like that I'd blow my voice out. Great tune.
not nostalgia,"It's not a black thing it's a soul thing ,if you got it you got it and he's got it , natural . If it's in you it's got to come out"
nostalgia,I heard these guys on the radio for the first time when I was in college. Thought they were a black soul group. Fantastic. Steve Winwood probably in his teens.
not nostalgia,It's a shame they aren't too popular or recognized now. They really are a great band with smashing songs.
nostalgia,he 60's and 70's were fantastic years for the rock. good times were that times
not nostalgia,I loved that song in the 60's. I had no idea until I read your comments that Stevie Winwood was singing it!
nostalgia,I was 14 when I first heard 17 year steve winwood fantastic on am radio to boot MONO no stereo
not nostalgia,"absolutely beautiful masterpiece, solid gold standard of excellence, phenomenal sound, top of the line great music & memories of life, 100% pure talent"

nostalgia,"This was my mum's song, her name is Laura, my dad always sing this to her everyday.. he is no longer with us but in our hearts he remains always.."

nostalgia,"when I used to do banger racing , we always played this in our lorry when ,we were on the way to a race meeting with the banger cars on the back . great times :-)"
nostalgia,My grandad listens this on a CD with me and I learned the words but sadly he passed away and we will miss and love him I lost him when I'm 11 I will always miss him:(

not nostalgia,Shout out to all the teens (like me) that can appreciate great tunes like this
not nostalgia,A  brilliant song that really highlights a tragedy so well.
nostalgia,banned from radio for been to sad personally i think my bonnie lies over the ocean is sadder and we used to sing that in school lol
not nostalgia,That is such a coincidence because Laura happens to be my 17th favourite name EVER
nostalgia,1960 I was a teenager and this was a very big No. 1.  It was in the charts for weeks.  A very memorable one hit wander
nostalgia,Brings back some good memories lol 
not nostalgia,"Decent version of the song, but until this video compilation I'd never pictured ""Laura"" as a cheap, trailer park skank."
not nostalgia,"do not create music like this anymore and people who have had sorrow knowing laura  it is  a personal thing ,but maybe the music adds comfort"
nostalgia,"My first love was a girl called Laura, a young 14 year old me but i never plucked up the courage to ask her out, we was best of friends for a long time during the early 90s but went our separate ways. 20 years later i found her on Facebook, got in contact, messages got flowing, we met up and 4 years later we married, had kids and living happily ever after. Joking, the first part was true, the later part is bullshit."
not nostalgia,grew up to these sort of songs better than the crap now can hear the words
not nostalgia,"The best music EVER created, and should NEVER be forgotten."
not nostalgia,The video lyrics are wrong in some cases and only half finished in others. 
nostalgia,Laura I remember lived at Blackstone crossroads I wonder where she is now???
not nostalgia,The young lady in this video is certainly not 1960 vintage. She's very much 21st Century.
not nostalgia,What a nice song such nice words made in calmer days not like to day do they make any good songs now?

nostalgia,I love all his songs bring back memories of yesterday
not nostalgia,Why do all the sad songs seem to bear my name?
nostalgia,Old men usually sing this to me. The caretaker at school sang it everyday to me and it was so embarrassing. I just need to find a Tommy now and life would be sweet 
not nostalgia,Please be careful about what you say. You are talking about a person who was the greatest  entertainer of our time thank you.
not nostalgia,This is the greatest concert in the history of music.
not nostalgia,"Gorgeous man, a voice that would melt your heart."
not nostalgia,"He was called the King, but still under-rated. I wish he had known how good he was."
nostalgia,"This played at my Grandad's funeral just over a year ago. It was one of his favorites. I'd kept my composure relatively in-check throughout the service, but as soon as this song started I completely and utterly lost it. My Nan is named Mary too, so it really hit home for all of us. Thinking about it now, this song is very melancholy but also very uplifting, which I guess makes it quite peaceful. There couldn't have been a more perfect song choice."
nostalgia,"Love this song so much, no one can sing it like Jim Reeves!I live in constant chronic pain, I listen to this song, reminds me of dancing with my husband who passed 3 years ago. He worked all over the world mining, when we got engaged we danced to this."
nostalgia,"My parents played this a lot when I was a kid and teen. My father is now living with me in his old age, and listening to this brought back a lot of feelings. My mum when she was alive and younger. My father as a man in his prime."
not nostalgia,You can see from his face when he sings those high notes in the last part how much he's satisfied with that voice and delivery.
not nostalgia,"I take nothing away from James Taylor when I make this statement.  He is no doubt one of the greatest artist in American Music and one of the most prolific song writers of all time. With that said, Taylor may have written this song to mock white blues artist but here's the thing, in my lifetime I've listened to his (Taylor's) version of the tune maybe three times.  "
not nostalgia,MOST  AWESOME SONG EVER AND SUNG BE THE COOLEST PERSON EVER AND HIS NAME IS ELVIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
not nostalgia,I just wish I could have seen him live just once. He was the best there will ever be for me.
not nostalgia,Priscilla had been gone over a year at this concert and Elvis appears FINE and enjoying the ride!
not nostalgia,"Just imaging him rolling over me right now lol My he was a stunning gorgeous looking fella. ?He certainly left this earth too soon however left his mark.,"
not nostalgia,"I love all genres of music singing by this  incredible Man,  but blues song  the most. Mr. Presley you were awesome singer. Really the Best of the Best. No doubt, you still do not have comparison  in the World. Great  in so many genres. Still only one."
not nostalgia,I like how he laughs at the beginning of the song then looks to the side.  Would love to know what he was thinking. Always and forever the King of all music
nostalgia,"Good lord, what a time to be alive, take me back to 73???"
not nostalgia,I'd love to hear the background for Elvis playing this 'parody on blues'...it's a great song period!
nostalgia,"Damn!!! I remember this moment when I was 20 or 21 depending on whether it was before or after Oct. 3rd of that year. I reconnected with an old GF I hadn't see in a few years and we hooked up again and her, her mother and I watched this live on TV back then at her mothers house. I think her name was Anna ..who knows what her last name might be now. Also I'd like to acknowledge Anita Macias...who I ran into at a grocery store about 20 years ago or more "
not nostalgia,I think he's his most comfortable with this low down bluesy style of music.. Definitely his roots
not nostalgia,"The greatest then, now and FOREVER! God bless you Elvis ,we miss you my friend."
nostalgia,I was around 6 years old in 73 I had to talk my mother to let me stay up late to to watch this . Elvis the true King
nostalgia,"We're all day to day, but hard to believe he passed less than 4 years after this."
not nostalgia,"Rest in peace Angel from God,unique voice,greatest artist on earth,the most handsome man,I see much sufferience in his eyes! Too much effort in concerts, that s why he died so young!"

not nostalgia,"If popularity were based solely on talent and feeling, Roy would've been the best-known performer of his generation. My favorite for sure!"
not nostalgia,"There's no soul in today's music, unlike songs from the 50's and 60's."
not nostalgia,"He was a talented singer. His voice was so complexing that I did not know if he was a Soprano,Tenor, Baritone or Bass."
nostalgia,From what I remember he used to sing with a teenage group called the "The Teen Kings"on one of our local tv channels at 6pm. I  would hurry home from school just to hear him sing. Never in my life did I think he was going become such a big star. We even went to some of dances where they played. Those were some great times back then.

nostalgia,"I remember an interview with Roy decades ago. Someone asked him why he sang like he did. He said that he did it because nobody told him it couldn't be done.He said that if someone had told him that, he probably would have developed a different style.From that I learned never to tell a young person that something is impossible."
not nostalgia,Agree 100% Always wished I could live back then
not nostalgia,i just looked this song up for english for a homework assignment and i now LOVE THIS SONG! and i just searched it 2 minutes ago
nostalgia,"My Mum went to see him every time he came to the UK. She said you could hear a pin drop when he sang, such was the appreciation.  She was lucky enough to have front row seats a few times.  My Father passed away in November 1988, and Roy passed a few weeks after.  She has not been able to play his music since unfortunatley.    But all I heard growing up was Roy, thank you Mum"
not nostalgia,I can totally understand your Mum. My man passed away two years ago and all I do when I listen to songs like this is cry. Very seldom that I dare to listen at all. Music can make you more vulnerable and then the feelings are there...  Love from Germany to you???
not nostalgia,Maybe the world has some hope.  I'm glad to hear some of the young folks like real rock and roll.  The stuff played today just doesn't have any heart. 
not nostalgia, I know the song you're talking about. I'm sure I have it on an album. I moved not long ago so I will have to dig to find it. It ended (as I remember) " I'll always be your baby through out the years" (I think).

not nostalgia,"I love this song, no matter how many times I hear it ... country / pop at its best !"

Patti Page's covers were beautiful  and still are ( She will be missed ) today.  Teresa Brewer sang  ""Mocking Bird Hill"" like a sad,  sleepy lullaby instead of something to wake up to. It was the WRONG interpretation!!!"
not nostalgia,Is there a place called mockingbird hill it would be great if there was

nostalgia,"This song has been embedded in my subconscious since I was little. So, fifty or so years later, I've had three wonderful grandsons, and now in 2015, a granddaughter!

nostalgia,my brother died age 23 his name was jimmy hearts never stopped crying we want him back 
nostalgia,"My mother sang this to me when I was little tyke, as Jimmy was my nickname. My brother, nicknamed Billy, got the much happier ""Billy Boy"" as his lullaby, and I always felt a little sad that he got such an upbeat song while I got one that was so sad.Nonetheless, thanks for sharing this. It had been far too long since I'd heard this. :)"

nostalgia,Sadly Missed my favorite singer of that period  What a guy a voice like silk all the asset's that make a Great Singer Crooner  This was when writers earned their corn writing great words to lovely music      When you consider the microphones were no where near as good as they are today  RIP Dickie what an entertainer you were
not nostalgia,"Frankie Vaughan had a couple of big hits,'Tower Of Strength,"" original ""Green Door"" Sang in my local in 1958. Very charismatic. ""The Crown hotel"",Gilmorton,UK."
not nostalgia,Further to my previous comment I now find that Dickie Valentine was voted top male vocalists in the NME poll for 6 years running from 1952 to 1957. Some guy called Frankie Vaughan was UK Male Vocalist for 1958 with a certain Mr Elvis Presley taking the international slot.

not nostalgia,"A great song sung by a great artist but I don't get what the movie clip has to do with the song. I mean at .045 of the clip she's singing about birds, and then the movie clip showing two people in a snow storm. AND THEN she sings about stars AND THERE'S NO STARS!!"
not nostalgia,Sometime I wish I lived during this time and then I remember racism and how I would  have probably been hanged lol so never mind
not nostalgia,The little girl with the great big voice - and you can understand every single word!
not nostalgia,"Makes heartbreak sound beautiful,  it's pain suckers"
nostalgia,It is now 2019 I am still listening and asking why.  I have been listening to the 70's station on seirus  radio which is really bringing the memories of my childhood. What a better world we lived in.
nostalgia,Listening November 2019.  Remembering a childhood of the 60s and 70s.  These songs really take me back.
nostalgia,Don't know but this song has some kind of magical spell that mesmerizes my soul and takes me to another word of dreams and nostalgias
nostalgia,It reminds me of my late sister. She used to love these songs and her fav songs are just a lonely memories for us
not nostalgia,Why do people from the past always look so much more beautiful and handsome from people of the present?
not nostalgia,A beautiful sad romantic love song
not nostalgia,I like her version more than the original.  She puts more feeling in the song and that is what makes the difference at least for me. Skeeter Davis made a good version too but this one is better to my way of seeing.
not nostalgia,"In later days women are more beautiful, more pretty, more intelligent, nicer!"
nostalgia,i remember my dad singing this
nostalgia,i was 16 in 1963. it makes me cry for my youth..
nostalgia,Nostalgic song. I adore
not nostalgia,The best version of this wonderful song I have ever heard. :)
not nostalgia,THIS IS A REASON WE SHOULD ALL CHERISH EVERY MOMENT WE HAVE !
not nostalgia,Thanks for the many beautiful stars on the silver screen.
nostalgia,"I was a junior in high school in High school part of 1963  second part of 63 I was a senior, Brenda well, every since she was a small girl. She never ever got very big, great singer  great songs, that also was Avery bad year for me, President Kennedy was shoot, very devistating, also good a good  year we where State Champs in Basketball that year, and lost a very dear friend in an accident,  And my grandfather died the night of my graduation"
not nostalgia,"Beautiful version of this song and one I like to hear.  Although it is a sad song it is very good to hear. It says true things when one is young and a love relationship breaks up, one feels like if everything bogged down.  It takes some time to recover and to live again."
not nostalgia,The greatest of compliments to Sironaca for her brilliant compilation of silver screen actors. Pure genius and hard work.
nostalgia,"I knew every word and sang this to sleep. I may have been just 6, but I understood and absorbed it."
nostalgia,"when I was  young, I  liked the music, now that I am old enough to understand  the meaning  of the song,  Thank you."
not nostalgia,"Great addition to this wonderful song to add the movie stills from the golden age of Hollywood. Do I get extra credit for being able to name well over half the men? I was stumped by a few of the women though, but Sophia and Veronica didn't get past me! It would be nice if someone could list all the stars shown. Offhand, without re-running the video, I can picture Glen Ford, John Wayne, Montgomery Clift, Alan Ladd, James Dean, John Barrymore, Spencer Tracy."
nostalgia,just stumbled across this...great version of this song...the best i've heard really..takes me back when my world was the world of a child...when the cement was wet but has long since hardened...so this song will always be with me...
nostalgia,"Sounds like sitting in the barber shop on Saturday morning during the snowy winter of 1963, waiting for my haircut. Dad came back and paid the barber 50 cents plus tip, and we went home for lunch. Can't go back there. No."
nostalgia,This is the first music I heard when I was young . And I love it  Dedicated to you Tara .
not nostalgia,I would love you if you let me
nostalgia,Lovely pictures..... sweet and sad nostalgia.....
nostalgia,OMG....early 60's please come back...
not nostalgia,I think most people at some point in their life would understand the meaning of this song. Music has the ability to express things we are unable to.
nostalgia,"Way back 2014, I was 11 when me and my grandfather would play this music in our car, and now  he's in heaven, still reminds me of him."
not nostalgia,This is my first love in music   . Without love life is nothing . It reflects also my belief in God .
not nostalgia,"does anyone know the corresponding movies to the pictures...? please comment, with time tag. thank you in advance"
not nostalgia,It's incredible how this kind of song makes me feel like missing out a time that I've never living in. I'm saying that 'cause I'm 27 and this song was released in 1963.
nostalgia,So much memories during with this 56 years
not nostalgia,I always thought this song are not from this planet
not nostalgia,"A promise we are waiting for to receive the reward of divine recognition of our work. And that is why we are working so hard to see our selves through to eternal grace, blessing of abandant welfare and welbeing"
not nostalgia,She could sing anything and always sounded great doing it.
not nostalgia,Did not know this song personally until it started playing. Automatically started singing with it. Thanks Bethesda Gaming in Fallout.
nostalgia,I was then 9 years old this song was popular and I always listen to it when my elder brother play it. It was fantastic!
not nostalgia,Goodnight thankfully  it   songs. I listened  to  that  thank you   for   so  much   as it  is
not nostalgia,YouTube recommended me some gold
not nostalgia,does anyone know the name of an actress in this clip? she holds a glass in one hand and in the background of the photo a man with a cigarette over his hand
not nostalgia,Broken hearts like anything can be mended...i am sorry you hurting but time will help x
not nostalgia,"Outstanding collection of music and the best singers in the world.   However, Brenda Lee seems a little out of place in this collection.   Otherwise, a real dopamine hit of the world's best music.  :-)"
not nostalgia,I recognized some of the people in the photos. I think it would be nice if the names of the people in the photos in the video was posted.
nostalgia,The good old days of teenage angst....child's play to life's real challenges.
not nostalgia,"I am so sorry to hear that. You can rest assured that she is not forgotten but all, list of all the ONE who can restore your loved one to you"
nostalgia,My dad was died in.1992 witch 55 years.  My mum died  2015. Age was 71 years old.  I miss  my  parents every  day.  They  loved  this song
not nostalgia,"Some really great slides here too.  These were real stars, and always will be!"
not nostalgia,Love the iconic images!!  just beautiful!!! they go perfect with the song!!  Great job Sironaca!!!  I've seen most these movies - that's why this video is so  special!!
nostalgia,I remember this song when i was 13 years old.
nostalgia,"This song always reminds me of my moms love for my dad. They were from this generation. And did everything they did back then. The cruise, the dances. I hear this song now in my head as my dad passed and mom goes on living."
not nostalgia,Always a great singer yes full emotion.. true to loving a person you love 
nostalgia,oh man  this was the song for my first love in 4 th grade..i moved away shortly after...love to you maggie hope life was kind to you!
not nostalgia,This is how you sing a song.  So many of the young crop of singers don't get this.  They're at 150 mph with the emotion for the entire duration of the song.  And they over-use the vocal fry.  I blame the singing teachers.  "Cookie cutter" singing is boring.
not nostalgia,I really wish I could have experienced this at the time it came out...
not nostalgia,Is it me but did not the actresses of years gone by look more beautiful and distinguish.
not nostalgia,"Does anyone know the dark haired actress ?. The one you can see when video is featured on youtube, you can see her face close up about half way through. Thank you"
nostalgia,I had a old car and the only station that came in was the oldies station and i would hear this song and others like it i love these songs it brings back good memories p.s. im only 34 years old but these ARE the best
not nostalgia,"Love me some Little Miss Dynamite, the voice of an angel God has sent us some great voices men and women. I just love great music by anyone, she had it all, second to no one...Peace and "
not nostalgia,wow...great interpretation of the song...this woman could really sing with a lot of emotion.
not nostalgia,Human Angel...I'm dreaming...some one slap me...wake me up...!
not nostalgia,Very nice put video with those pictures and the song fits for those pictures. Pictures tell a whole new story with their face expressions.  K U D O S !
nostalgia,Bring back the time
nostalgia,It is so refreshing to hear great songs of a long-gone childhood.  The Youth of today don't know the wonderful music they are missing from the 60s 70s and 80s. The high school dances with no bouncers or police.  The summer night rock in the park parties.  There were no drugs.  Just love and tenderness with your favourite girl.  We respected each other  and ourselves.  We didn't spend money we didn't have. We didn't mutilate our bodies with tattoos and piercings. 
not nostalgia,The world will never end when listening to this genuinely touching song sung around the world! /Peter Chen
nostalgia,Ooh!!!  I got the sweet pain.  All those school days reminded. Reminded me of All those who never came back. Did Anybody feel the same???
not nostalgia,Just be glad this beautiful life was briefly shared with us.. We can leave this life with the joy from her heart.... and the feeling she left us with her beautiful voice.
nostalgia,This song reminds me of my first boyfriend and my best friend stole him away from me shame on them both I kept playing this over and over.......
nostalgia,beautiful song from my childhood beautiful woman and beautiful song
not nostalgia,Thank you so much for these beautiful moments I like this song <3
nostalgia,"I was in a boarding school, and not by choice, nor due to money. I was thirteen years old when I heard this song looking out the windows, hoping to have a visit from my mother. She never came, I felt like that song that day. Now when I don't hear from my children or grandchildren, this song still comes to mind. Just sharing"
nostalgia,You can never go back to the good old days. But this song sure can bring you back!!
nostalgia,the song is full of emotions brings back the loss of being dumped by my first girlfriend 
not nostalgia,A very unusual voice which I've come to like quite a lot. AND she sang that monumental hit 'Sorry' - her version absolutely gut-wrenching.
nostalgia,The very first top 40 hit I remember from my childhood.
not nostalgia,"Great song, great images, poor arrangement. The jumping images are a huge distraction."
nostalgia,"Evokes many happy memories, thanks."
nostalgia,Yes I miss old those old memories
not nostalgia,"Brilliant. Makes my heart feel good. Thinking all the lost changes, all the things that really happened and the good things that will happen. Even its sad song, but still. Wish everyone the best."
nostalgia,"My parents taught us to love and appreciate great artists of the 1960's. At the age of 13,  I  already knew this song we used to sing Connie Francis' songs and many others. Beautiful ageless songs."
nostalgia,It was long long ago as I was young. I remember what I was high school boy.
nostalgia,"This is a time when, there were gorgeous people, beautiful music, an we knew every word,, pity humanity had changed, for the worse I must say, so glad I was a youngster during this beautiful time in human history, music wise, an movies as well,, with the most handsome of men, an gorgeous of women."
nostalgia,the oldies song is the best medicine of the lonely heart I remember my parents and my love ones who passed away
nostalgia,Thank you so much for these marvelous moments so nice to remember <3

nostalgia,brings back memories?? miss u ate :(
nostalgia,"Some years ago when l was a little boy,my father always this song and he  really it.Now he was not here,l just come find some memories with my father in here"
not nostalgia,I believe a very few modern singer today can perform as the Little Dynamite could. She was superb. I love her
not nostalgia,so many beautiful screen legends and couples overlapped with a heavenly song <3
nostalgia,What a marvelous song to remember even in 2018 . Thanks for these beautiful moments. <3
nostalgia,Thanks dear Sironaca for this great song remembering good time passed and we like to listen again in 2018 <3
not nostalgia,UNBELIEVABLE PERFORMANCE. NEVER AGAIN YOU WILL HEAR THIS KIND OF MELODY.
not nostalgia,"I just don't think they make them anymore.  My goodness Brenda Lee sang these torch songs at fifteen or younger and I'm sure the reality of the lyrics were barely understood by the singer herself. But she hit the home of my heartstrings every time. Still in my set list, Brenda Lee will always one of my all time favorites."
not nostalgia,Beautiful and I am offering to all our dear friends wherever you are. I am asking God to bless and protect you always. <3
not nostalgia,What an amazing voice. Makes me see the story of her songs and brings tears to my eyes. Absolutely beautiful!
not nostalgia,This is song is so powerful and meaningful. I know this song's been apart of many movie soundtracks. And if you really listen to the lyrics you'll understand why people love this song.
nostalgia,Now that's a memory I forgot about.
not nostalgia,A lot of todays music and singers are total garbage compared to this!
nostalgia,I was a teenager and she was the only singer that I cared to listen to.
nostalgia,"Bringing back wonderful memories,they were Happy Days."
nostalgia,"always loved this. i heard it when i was young, but i am still young. 67 years and still love all the older song. they mean so much."
not nostalgia,yes a love affair that it ends the moment when you are separated by him
not nostalgia,"Music is fantastic. I am not so sure about the video...  Very strange transition between frames, most off putting :-("
not nostalgia,"the voice of a real singer, full of emotion and feeling, we have heard her for more than 50 years and she sounds like heaven, never tire of listening to this great lady love you brenda"
nostalgia,"In 1962, when I was 17 years old, this song was popular here in Korea. It was 56 years ago from now. I was singing songs with my friends in town to memorize this song lyrics! I was going to sing along when I was all over the speakers through the speakers!"
nostalgia,"In 1963 I was 12 years old. Brenda Lee performed at the Greater Gulf State Fair in Mobile, Alabama. I was at that performance and I got to meet her. After that I was so in love with her I couldn't think of anything else and couldn't sleep at night. Every cent of my earnings and allowance went to buy her records and my little Japanese transistor radio with the single earplug stayed on every minute of everyday just in case one of her songs played on the radio."
not nostalgia,"What an emotional song! And amazing video! By the way, is it Paulette Goddard at 1:37? Thank you ever so much!!!!!"
not nostalgia,Such a brilliant version of this classic.  And in lovely lovely stereo. Left ear strings and choir.... Right ear perfect piano.... In the middle a voice in a million. Thank you.
not nostalgia,As a glorious gun battle ensues. The misunderstood vigilante makes his last stand against  tyranny..
nostalgia,"I hope I have the dates right. It was early 1963? It was a very snowy winter and I was in the Upper South. I used to doze off listening to this lovely song on snow days, when it had to really snow for us to get out of school!"
not nostalgia,"I have never heard of this woman, fantastic voice!!!! Was she an actress?"
nostalgia,"nice tune,catchy music, simpler times, bring them back"
nostalgia,Brings back awesome memories...
not nostalgia,"I like this, but the original is better. The original flows better in my opinion"
not nostalgia,"Still a better song,romantic and classy song than almost every song nowadays which describe a rebellious and horny love story"
not nostalgia,and that's why they called her lil  miss dynamite...shes a one and only
nostalgia,I love this song. Really reminds me of my early days in the Philippines. My sister and i danced to this song in a party . Part of the contest for most romantic dancers. I think i was around 14 at that time and my sister was 15 years old.
not nostalgia,Brenda does a great job on this song originally sung by Skeeter Davis and Brenda brings the same emotion to it.
not nostalgia,she was one of the greats .why cant we have more like this today?
nostalgia,"my childhood ,years passed by but the memories stays same"
nostalgia,memories are made of these. Love everyone always. 
not nostalgia,Does anyone know who the film star is at 1:53? It certainly fits in well with a superb song and singer
nostalgia,This song reminds me of Robbie Benson for some reason.  Great 70's tune  from my childhood. 
nostalgia,Wow this song brought back some great days! !! Thanks sears! !!
not nostalgia,Her version of almost every female vocal rock&roll song will be the best.
not nostalgia,Can anybody recognize a woman at 2:40 Very cute unforgettable woman
not nostalgia,"A child prodigy. She had a comfortable command of her voice. From her signature flat to her signature vibrato. She was at ease, and seemed to effortlessly deliver an amazing voice and concert presence. A special vocalist."
not nostalgia,"Lyrics don't seem the same in songs today, this is a shame. yes there are lovely young ones but sadly they will not experience the post war baby boomer time , I really have a doubt an era like this will ever come again.."
not nostalgia,Hey this is easily the best version - the slower moodier and sadder pace coupled with her plaintive voice. And lovely black and white photographs too to enhance the effect and add to the magic sparkle from days long gone by.
not nostalgia,I don't know how you do what you did to create what you did with this great audio and wonderful video but all I can say is thank you.
nostalgia,Simple times. Oh how I miss them
nostalgia,The good old days when you could like a song and not worry about social backlash from your peers.
not nostalgia,You know this song if you learn English from Messages books
nostalgia,Oh remember when I was like 4 years old and my dad used to play this song I remember it because it was the first song I learned even though I didn't know English at that age :)
nostalgia,"Stationed in Germany with the USAF, during the early 70's.  Wow does this flood the mind with memories."
not nostalgia,My grandpa send me this song and wow it is good but it is not great either
not nostalgia,"Somehow never heard this until the Samsung commercial, which is hilarious....good song!"
nostalgia,A TV commercial brought me to this song.  I remember this song when I was a child.  Sweet memories
nostalgia,It reminds me of Sunday rides with an ex. Love it!
not nostalgia,"the more i listen to sound of older music the more i turn out to be happy, but listening to the newcomers just makes me wonder how much more retarded it can get ..."
nostalgia,This is a song from my childhood. Brings back great memories.
nostalgia,"This song reminds me of long hot summers when I was a teenager and although I didn't really like it at the time, nostalgia has mellowed me. It was used in the soundtrack to the film ""Cupcakes"" that I saw the other day and I really wanted to hear it again. Love it!"
nostalgia,"Memories ,another classic."
nostalgia,"I remember the words to this song like it was yesterday, which is well over 40 some years ago....Sears really brought back some memories."
not nostalgia,How can a man put on his jeans as soon as he wakes up? Morning glory
not nostalgia,Funny how Michael Jackson still gets played on the radio though and is regarded as a legend . 
nostalgia,...evokes old memories & makes you yearn for days gone by ! A timeless song !
nostalgia,"As the memories come back while hearing this song, all I can think is the past is gone now as is Miss Karen. However she lives on in her music, and as long as we remember her and our long gone loved ones we have lost through the years, then they are never totally gone. I have a distant hope that there will be a new day for us all......some day."
nostalgia,"I can still remember the day I first heard this music nearly twenty years ago that is my first time listening English songs. Two songs, one is say you say me another is this, deeply in my memory, at that time I was a teenager in a small chinese town! Never forget"
nostalgia,"I have great memories of my childhood in the 70's  playing in the backyard and my mom sitting outside on the patio in the sun, an AM radio softly playing this kind of music. I miss being young, my mom and 1970's AM radio stations. My own Wonder Years."
not nostalgia,"Look we all know about the crap that he did, but back in the day he made some great tunes he co wrote, also he knew how to sell himself on stage and get the crowd behind him, which is a plus. The rest sadly is history."
nostalgia,what a band great  sound and good times back then wish there was someone round like this now
nostalgia,"i cant knock him for being great at the time, as a kid we loved him at the time awesome times , go 70s : )"
not nostalgia,The song is great. Glitter - not so great. People all over the world are probably throwing their Gary Glitter CDs into the dustbin these days.
not nostalgia,i don't want to be leader of your gang thank you very much lol !
not nostalgia,Everybody's got an excuse when they're a nonce. The rest of us are just honest about liking the music.

nostalgia,Wow I was 16 when this came out! Incredible but good memories.
not nostalgia,Thank god for my parents wow i wish my gen of music was this funky and used more instruments
not nostalgia,"Nice song of the seventies.  This is the sort of music I like as it is meaningful, has a cool rhythm and is nicely performed. I frankly do not like what is being made nowadays with a few exceptions.  I don't find any significance in it. But this one as all tunes of those times signified something and something good."
nostalgia,This just makes me smile... My heart dances... 1976... So many records did that to me. So hard to find stand out tracks of that year... But this one certainly is one of the most memorable for me.. Love it!!
not nostalgia,Man!  How many talent shows in the black community did group perform this song? ..The brothers could sing just like Tavares.. Swoon! I  love my black people stay moving and living your best life..
not nostalgia,Heard this music from Titans this classic song is amazingly beautiful and gorgeous thank you Titans

nostalgia,definitely brings back great 70's memories
not nostalgia,I am from india and i love this kind of songs. Heard this in Titans series.
nostalgia,I fell in love with this song the summer of 1977.  The year of my 9th grade graduation from John Wannamaker Jr. High school and the summer of my first real love.  Loved it then and love it now!!
nostalgia,"Music memories, playing this on my twin cassette deck out fishing or camping as a 19 year old in remote north Western Australia.  Life passes by so quickly,  gets lonely as you get older sometimes and music brings on nostalgia,  love it though, glimpses of my past through music"
nostalgia,What a fantastic intro this song has. Takes me right back to the summer of 76 with not a mobile phone to be seen. When people loved to dance and drink and hold a conversation. Really miss those days
nostalgia,"Had just graduated from college and got a dream job with IBM, what great memories! :D"
nostalgia,"Marvellous memories, music is miracles!"
not nostalgia,Taking out the fade in then i can like it.

not nostalgia,Good and Real Music Right here! Thanks to my Mom playing real music around me and sharing real music to me.
nostalgia,"I used to have a 70s CD box as a kid, I listened and danced to it in my room every damn day. Songs like this bring me back to this, not a worry in the world. Good times"
nostalgia,Miss those days. And I get homesick when hearing oldies.
not nostalgia,This has got to be the best structured song I've ever heard
not nostalgia,I'm curious to know how many of the original members of Tavares are still living now?
nostalgia,One of those nice songs of yester year I had not listened to in a long time perhaps as much as 40 years. It brings to me so many merry memories of those times.  I like the idea of comparing a loved girl with an Angel. Very good really.
nostalgia,"When I was 14 years old, I remember to save every penny I got for to get the 45 rpm record disc of this beautiful song. When a did, I don?-t remember how many times I played in the old disc player at home"
not nostalgia,Yeah supernatural bought me here. You happy?!

nostalgia,Man I remember this riding with my Dad on my way to school in the first grade good memories now I'm driving my son to school playing old school music
not nostalgia,This is the best to dance to for the Disco era.  I love dancing to it.
nostalgia,This brings back a good memory for me. I am 28 years old but I remember being 5 or 6 listening to this in the car with my grandma. It was sunny day in Summer we were by the beach just she and I. ...I felt good that day. Thats the day I heard and fell in love with this song.
nostalgia,I love this. It's one of the best disco records ever.! but it reminds me when I was nearly thrown off of a spinning Waltzer at Minehead funfair. My summer holiday 1976  aged 12.  No safety belts in the 70's.!!
not nostalgia,This song is so beautiful even though it's only disco. I would have to say it's the most romantic and elaborate disco (after A Fifth of Beethoven and the instrumental-only version of Beegees Saturday Night Fever) Heaven Must Be Missing An Angel fires up my imagination. I see a Princess cruise ship (like the one on Love Boat) out at sea and a lot of happy romantic couples dancing and kissing walking around arm in arm or shoulder on shoulder. So gorgeous.
nostalgia,Brings back so many memories Great song group and Artists
not nostalgia,"I, STIL CANNOT GET OVER HOW HANDSOME THEY ALL WERE...AND THEY STILL LOOK GOOD. AND SOUND GREAT."
nostalgia,Whenever I just want to be taken back to 1976 and 18 years  old.....I just listen to this
nostalgia,"This takes me back to my ""Soul Train"" days. Watching it, not actually dancing there! But it was still fun."
nostalgia,"When I was little this was the BEST song I have ever heard in my entire life. I heard this song at an air show back in 70's. There was a Fighter Pilot flying a brand new jet back then called an F-15 strike eagle, who introduced it to the crowd with this song. We had very large speakers behind the crowd that played this song as he went through his entire flight routine. This was the only time in my entire life that I ever saw one man in one plane actually out perform the Blue Angels "
not nostalgia,Priceless ..Classic..Golden Age of Real Music for the Listening Pleasure.! 
nostalgia,its so good so good brings me back i was like 10 years old then 47 now wow....

nostalgia,"Across times, bring me back to yeas back."
nostalgia,This song will forever remind me of my friend joy. I swear on my life she was as close to karen carpenter's voice if not identical to Karen and this was my favorite song that i liked to hear joy sing when we were doing karaoke and i swear she made me cry each time she did i haven't talked or heard from joy in years the last time i talked to her she said she had cancer and after that we lost touch i hope she beat that cancer and is still singing Karen's songs as beautifully as she .

nostalgia,"Takes me back to my childhood, lovely memories."
nostalgia,"Every time i listen to this song, i am always reminded about how carefree life was and how things were on its right places. It makes me cry that those good old days will only remain as memories. But those memories will forever be kept."
nostalgia,"I miss the 70's . we had less 'tech' , but it was a better world and times. simpler and funner."
nostalgia,My memories come back.!! #2019.!
nostalgia,This song reminds me when I was young
nostalgia,"My mom loved the Carpenters and so when I hear their songs, it brings me good memories of riding in the car with my mom singing to these tunes."

These songs were band to be broadcasted. But beautiful songs were strong enough to break the iron firm rules and were heard from here and there in streets.  When my childhood was poor not able to afford a Carmen castes player, I already could sing these songs in 1970s. Love these songs! "
not nostalgia,"Funny, but so many generations an say this about the music of their youth, and it is true to them.

not nostalgia,Life is short world is cruel but I will never surrender to the darkness
not nostalgia,"It's amazing to think that ""Bad, Bad Leroy Brown"" kept this song out of the Billboard #1 slot!  We were pretty stupid in the 70s. This is possibly the best Pop Rock song ever written."
not nostalgia,"Probably the best female voice out there ever? So many hits! When she sang she really put so much emotion into the songs it is as if she personally is feeling those emotions. Some very, well, depressing, but what people go through at times and can relate with I believe. Richard, it is said, never got the credit he deserved for this music. Musicians know the truth I guess. She passed at 32...imagine another 30 years with their duo combination?"
nostalgia,"I remember my neighbor cathy bringing the singles album over to my house back in 1974 and we had a record player on the living room floor and we all sat around listening to the music.

nostalgia,This song made me cry reminds me of my childhood miss those happy times

nostalgia,"I remember when I first heard this wonderful song. I was riding in the back seat of my father's 1956 DeSoto. I remember the song coming on and how it grabbed my attention. I can honestly say this is the first song I truly liked in my childhood. I had to be about 4 or 5. Now, nearly half a century later, everytime I hear it, I am back in the old DeSoto with a big smile on my face. Thank you Karen. You left us too soon. There has never been a voice as beautiful and rich as yours."

not nostalgia,"Well, it is a sing-a-long class even the car is a bolt on. Fresh off the steamer. Thank you for asking me to shove the pie into the boot, to make sense of blacklane."
not nostalgia,Saw a comment on another video that they still play this song on the radio in Viet Nam.... Sad its not played in America.
not nostalgia,"the more I listen to this, the more depressed and sadder I am, I wished I could have done better and got everything fixed... I know being sad can undo nothing, but you just couldn't help yourself from that. :("
nostalgia,"When I first listened to this song I was just ten or eleven. Back then I only knew how to appreciate the nice melody and the great voice.And now I am eighteen, struggling in the pain due to my studies, my family and...And I can strongly resonate with the lyrics now .Those happy times in my childhood..."
not nostalgia,"Last Monday, I cried for 30 minutes straight listening to this song while reading the sad ending of The Awakening by Kate Chopin."
not nostalgia,She is so pretty and very good singer!! Is she mixed-race or Latina???
nostalgia,I felt so alive then.it brings it all back I had a great life and stell am
not nostalgia,This is incredible! Sounds like a 90s house track and she's just a child too!! Wow!!
not nostalgia,"She has a southern accent, although i think she was a DC girl. Come Moan.  Moan? LOL."
not nostalgia,This sounds fresh in 2019 ! Timeless disco don't hear it often even on disco /house shows
not nostalgia,"Good times! And she was only 14, just wow! It's concerning that her hair is the same shape as my bell end but it was fashionable  back then I guess"
not nostalgia,Is she mixed race? As when I first heard this I thought it was black girl singing. Either way she has a fantastic voice!
nostalgia,Jesus remember dancing to this at the Capital Radios best disco in town on a Friday night at the Lyceum Ballroom in London with the best Dj  Greg Edwards.
not nostalgia,"Disco declined rapidly in 1980, and by July 1981 it was totally dead. Why??? There has always been attempts from the 90s for revival, but only short lived. Very sad."
nostalgia,Lots of childhood memories
not nostalgia,Love this track especially as feeling low in #Liverpool #ItsLiverpool but this tune is making me feel much #Happier
nostalgia,I remember playing handball with me and my friends busting this song until 3pm everyone in the neighborhood high tail it home to watch a Shaw Brother flick on Saturday .
not nostalgia,"Young, gifted and well done for doing what a lot of people only dream of. Such a nice voice at a tender age, I wonder where she is now"
not nostalgia,You all know this was a mess. she was popular but she just couldn't dance and had no stage presence. That hair oh my why? I could think of a million other things to do with the hair.Her heart wasn't in show business and it showed. She retired before the age of 25. I have never seen anyone in show business but her do this. There are people who wish that they could have been this popular.
nostalgia,"The good old days , reminds me of the silver blades Birmingham Sundays"
nostalgia,I was a barman in the UK when it came out and loved it so much I'd pop out of the bar to feed the Jukebox to keep it playing over and over. Never knew she was only 14 or 15 at the time.
not nostalgia,Adorable yet there is also a complexity and nuance in her voice beyond her years
nostalgia,Absolutely LOVE this !! Brings back memories of my Dad playing this when I was little. Miss you so much Dad. The 11th of July 2019 will always be the saddest day of my life. Love you forever Dad RIP 
nostalgia,"What a fabulous song ,and great   great band ,well done for bringing back lovely memories thank you Shirley h Darlington England"
not nostalgia,"I don't really understand the people that say this band was underrated or underappreciated. Yes they have maybe never got their full due, but I lived these years and they were popular, made great hits and we knew it. The problem with being fully rated was mostly because they did not stay together long enough. We know they are great and many after their time see it also."
not nostalgia,"Beautiful Tony is playing his ""Black Beauty""...............that's what I call a super windy day, good thing they didn't blow into the English Channel, that would have been a real laugh. This is another great song that I never tire of !!! Wish their songs were longer though, a few staves more wold have been nice."
nostalgia,"I am 57 now and in many respects I do not feel my age at all, but when it comes to music and I see and hear what people are listening to today, I want to climb into a time machine and press 1965 and go back.    There is very little today that moves me in the way that the stuff from 1963-1979 did."
not nostalgia,No one cares about history. The Hollies clearly could be in the same conversation with regard to 3 part vocal harmonies as the Beatles. But the Beatles took it to another level that no one could match.
not nostalgia,"Hey guys, have you ever noticed how Nash turns around towards the end of the song and looks into the harbor? I have often wondered if he heard a ships horn and was looking around instinctively. Yes, these are the kinds of things I think about. Go ahead and laugh!"
not nostalgia,"Would you guys laugh at me if I told you that I fantasize being in a band playing this song, and everyone is clapping and going crazy?"
nostalgia,grow up with 60s music as my mum listen to it on captial gold every sunday the  song came out 7 years before i was born just love their  music  the harmonys are just amazing can listen to it over and over again
not nostalgia,"Anybody else think this song might have been whispering in the minds/memories/ears of The Who when they wrote ""I Can See For Miles""?  The beginning of that song seems to parallel the beginning of this one where you think, ""Hey, I know I've heard that melody before"".  Love both songs but always think of the other when hearing it and vice versa.  The Hollies song came first in 1966 with The Who's following in '67.  Just wondering if anybody else who's always been more familiar ."
nostalgia,"I bought this 45 in 1966 when I was thirteen years old and I played it over and over again on my teenage record player.  It's still perfect, exciting, rousing --- certainly among the very best of the great music of its day.  The Hollies harmonies are soaring.  I never get tired of this song.  The smiles on the faces of the singers are so full of genuine pleasure, it is wonderful to watch them perform it."
nostalgia,"As a young teenager I heard my older sisters Hollies records and was immediately struck by the drumming of Bobby Elliott. I can now say it was because it was perfect, never too much or too little. That's what I tried to remember while playing drums for over twenty years. Oh yes, great song and singing too!"
nostalgia,Thank you Carl for the nostalgic memories.
not nostalgia,"This is really, really good. Of course I've heard this before, but never paid any attention before."
not nostalgia,"Herbert Wells wrote a series of novels ""Shape of Things To Come"" in 1930s  where he tried to predict the future of next 150 years. He was pretty good predicting WWII but could not predict that Hitler would attack Soviet Union, so his predictions went wrong from start actually."
not nostalgia,"Love this tune! Stopped in a gas station yesterday,and heard this in the store system,so I commented to the kid at the register about what a great band this was.She never heard of them. Very sad."
not nostalgia,"Too bad the face of the singer dominates the video.  Other band members deserved equal camera recognition, especially since they played instruments and the lead singer did not."
not nostalgia,"no matter if you are 14 like me or a person who grew up with the British invasion, we can agree that this is some good music"
nostalgia,"i was 10 and i remember my brother bringing this home on 45rpm, my favorite Yardbirds record."
nostalgia,The british invasion had some of the best music. Brings back great high school  memories that slipped away all too fast.
nostalgia,"I was in High School too, listening this music when most kids were listening to the Beatles.  These guys were singing about what I was witnessing.  Not the Beatles.  The Yarbirds were the first protest and anti-establishment soldiers.  The beginnings of the youth revolt against the old guard.  Good memories!  Makes me wanna ""burn a doob"" if I still did that sort of thing."
nostalgia,"These cats were never given the 'props' they so rightly deserved. 1966 was a GREAT year for music (I was only 12 years old then, but the memories are priceless) & The Yardbirds were way ahead of their time musically."
not nostalgia,"These guys were cooler than anyone out there now. And, the music was from the future. Brilliant , without compare.  Come tomorrow, we may all be soldiers."
not nostalgia,"It has already crossed the mind of a few fans like you to write a biography themselves... I think there are already one or two in the making, I'm not sure...Only time will tell!... ;-)"
not nostalgia,"Looks like you may be right!!! But I can't give you a straight answer here, as I'm not a guitarist expert, I'm afraid! ;-)"
not nostalgia,"Anybody else here just getting into the likes of Elvis and The Beatles? I always saw them as old sounding type of thing,ironically I really love 80s too. But once I started listening to them,I can't stop,they have so many great,influential tunes. "
nostalgia,"Love this, timeless and brings back memories."
nostalgia,"Now or Never, my favorite song. This takes me back to first time I met my husband"
not nostalgia,This is the first time I have really been blown away by his singing. Embarrassed to admit how long it took before I actually LISTENED to this.
not nostalgia,If this song doesn't make your heart race then you might need to get it checked by your Doc.  I wish I could of seen how he puts you in a dream state and hypnotizes every single girl in the audience.
nostalgia,I agree it was one of his best songs ever he's had a few out there I always have been intrigued with Elvis my brother had all his Elvis albums and then I was intrigued after he passed away I read all his books I got from the library this man was freaking awesome he was handsome he made history he was just so millions and millions of Records awesome rest in peace Elvis Presley
not nostalgia,Tomorrow  will be to late.... so true!   I was named after this dude and his twin that died at birth...apparently  him  anyone seen Jesse the gospel singer??   Striking resemblence...  we all go back to the Gospel in the end
not nostalgia,"To be honest, old songs were the best. The songs nowadays just gives the elders headache!"
nostalgia,"Popular, lot of air play the summer before my senior year. Great song. Great memories."
not nostalgia,You know I'm not gonna be rude about this go to the new music that I here today sounds  like crap  like Gucci gang or Rolex what is that wait let me think GARBAGE Elvis is the KING and no can replace this  magnificent person seriously this  is music if you agree people please like because I  think I"m right!!
not nostalgia,I wanna listen to this song when I get to Hawaii and dance with my partner to this song at the beach... Such a dream
not nostalgia,Did you know that this song is the 4th best selling single worldwide?
nostalgia,"I get flashbacks from this song when I was a child living in southern Italy, where every street was filled with lovers, compassionate for each other, and confessing there feelings"
nostalgia,"my dad loved this song so much,he used to sung this song when I was a kid. I miss my dad in heaven .... :)"
not nostalgia,the only thing i dont like about listening on youtube is that the comment section is always  a circle jerk of  "born in the wrong generation"  kids that think they're the only smart ones because they listen to old music.
not nostalgia,Wow you guys sure are special for listening to one of the most recognizable artists of the 20th century. When do you want your medal to come in the mail?
not nostalgia,this kind of music is way better than the music now and if you listen carefully this kind of music tells a story thank God for that.
nostalgia,Remind me of when I am 7 years old listening to this song on my way to school in my dad's car
not nostalgia,So glad I was brought up on this guy.  The best musician that ever lived and still lives on in our hearts.  The king of music he was and still is
not nostalgia,"I'm from Naples, so I speak the mother tongue of the original version of this song, but I must say I think this is much, much more charming than the original :-)"
not nostalgia,"I'd love for people of my age group to realise that music from the past isn't as historic as fossils and that it's a much more basic and illicit alternative to what they currently listen to. As a 17 I have come to the conclusion that my music taste, compared to others my age, has been bold and at some points non existent. However, pretty much all music I here from the 40s, 50s, and 60s (in my experience) is never as explicit or profane as modern music."
nostalgia,"Love this song , so many memories . Glen sang it brilliantly , but take a listen to george benson singing it  . Pure awesomeness"
not nostalgia,2019 is just another milestone in evolution of music as was the 80s...I am sure in the year 2040 it will still evoke similar response....

You don't have to be that person anymore ! Yes you are crazy exciting but I've seen what's there behind it and I love that more. Yes I see the star it's all I can see when I look up at night. I love you 
nostalgia,"Why there is no singer today who can sing this innocent way so pure so gentle, Why it always have to be about sexuality or violence? I wish i was born in those times...."
not nostalgia,Nothings gonna change my love for you! If you read this wuv remember were almost 6 months strong I have a got feeling you will read this :)
not nostalgia,"I send this song to my husband for the last Valentine Day, he loved it. We are together since 1998, my first boyfriend, I was 15 years old and him 22 years old. "
not nostalgia,"That's what's wrong with today!!  Songs, aren't written from the heart. Now, it just materialistic bullshit!! Where's the love in that? Will they give their life for you? That is true love..."
not nostalgia,"I want to know who gave a thumbs down, really, in person!!  What is wrong with you?!  One of the most romantic songs of all time.  Love it!"
not nostalgia,True this track but have you ever thought about if: If her love is going to change for you because it may very might be?! Be ready for it just incase especially in this era nothing's sacred as it's not 1988 anymore!! Still otherwise a great song but don't be a fool without having a backup plan!!

not nostalgia,this song says it all when you have a true lady to say how much the love you have for her x
not nostalgia,Someone should do a new version of this.  Fantastic little song.
not nostalgia,"Gone are the days when people sing real music, today they sing about nothing"
nostalgia,I swear this song was released in 1985 until I looked into it. Loved it in the 80s it brings back find memories.
nostalgia,"Memories I had at this time of this song 18 years, that it goes fast, but always beautiful to listen to"
not nostalgia,"This video outbeats Despecio and Taylor swift by a trillion light years, it deserves more views, it makes me wonder if something is wrong with the brains of most humans."

nostalgia,"I remember learning to slow dance to this song in my best friend is backyard, the summer 1988"
not nostalgia,"I have a certain man on my mind, omg his hugs are the best. It takes my breath away just thinking about the hug I gave him, he held me tight."
not nostalgia,He must've been getting laid so fucking much back then! In 1987 he looked a lot like Shawn Mendes now
nostalgia,"Wow..,this song takes me back to my childhood,beautiful years beautiful music,,hahaha it makes me .So happy to had experienced the 80s..ONE LOVE"
not nostalgia,Okay lets look at this The man changes his shirt three times and you know got a crucifix on
not nostalgia,"Where would we be without soft focus?!   Certainly not in the 1980's, that's for sure"

nostalgia,This was our song I messed up and I'll live the rest of my life knowing it. You was the best thing in my life. I just wish I could turn the clock back. We was so happy I'll never get that with anyone else never...
not nostalgia,This is what's missing in this world. LOVE..REAL LOVE. ..this is a banger no matter what year we in best believe 
nostalgia,Can someone build a time machine please? We need/ must bring this music back
not nostalgia,That's what I call a thing deserver of being called 'EVERGREEN'. It's not just a song.  It has got happiest moment of a thousand people's life.  It's priceless 
nostalgia,damn takes me back to Jr high school dances working up the nerve to ask someone to dance.
not nostalgia,Makes me think of the love I feel for someone so bad and they do not believe it. Nothing is going to change how I feel....god I am crying now...

not nostalgia,"Since he's a teacher now, I wonder if he sings ""Nothing's gonna change detention for you. You'll never ever know how bad I caught you!"" lol"
nostalgia,A time when romance and love actually mattered. Boys would call a girl on the phone for a date. Seemed like love and marriage was the path to a happy life. Now money and jobs have taken the place of love and marriage. How sad that we no longer value the things that make life worth living.
nostalgia,One of timeless classics.. This is my favorite song and it reminds me of those days
not nostalgia,"I feel like he could've been a huge movie star. He was pinup boy attractive, had a soft romantic side (not typical for a teenage dude) and seemed natural on screen."
not nostalgia,"i love this song ,lovely .its all about love.i still have the same feeling for the wife i married 18 years ago. This song truly says all,nothing gonna change my love for my ever loving wife."
not nostalgia,"ALL these years, I had no idea this was sung by a kid! Didn't find out until a couple weeks ago (May 2018). It seems to add an honest innocence to it."

not nostalgia,Although not in front of a blue screen this is probably the lowest budget music video I've ever seen LOL
not nostalgia,"Sad that he looks like a typical middle-aged guy now. Wish he still looked more like this, but I guess when you're so handsome/cute when young, you almost naturally go downhill. He should've worked harder to preserve his looks though"
nostalgia,I'm 18 again. It's the summer of 1988 and the sixth form leaving party. Fond memories.

nostalgia,I was 12 when this song was released.  I recorded it on a tape and gave it to a 12 year old girl who I swore at the time I'd stay forever with.  Oh man... the beauty and serenity of innocence of puppy love.

nostalgia,I wish these days were back again!
not nostalgia,"One of the best romantic pop songs to emerge from an era chock full of great ones. For the curious, Mr. Mederios went on to reinvent himself as an educator and now is the president of a college prep school in HI. Pretty cool, IMHO."
not nostalgia,I think songs that are about how you gonna take her from behind etc and other modern music is much better:)

nostalgia,"I fell in love with this innocent boy and never knew his name. His song always seemed to come on tv after school.And I would watch him doe-eyed. This song brought back memories of a time when I was still optimistic about the future. He must be old now, because I am 40 years old....man, time flies."
not nostalgia,Great music that actually meant something these days its all about looks in music videos.
not nostalgia,I do not have a girlfriend but this song makes me cry everytime! Its funny and sad at the same time. I hope you have a great 2017

not nostalgia,The singing sounds live here. Not quite like the record. Love that.
nostalgia,"Fantastic live version! Beautiful voices, beautiful faces. Brings me back to 14 years old in 1966. Thank you Scott and John, RIP."
not nostalgia,One of the best what a performance..always loved this says much.....Thank you Scott for you talent...Rest in Peace  ...amen...the sun ain't gonna shine anymore.
nostalgia,the song reminds me and the 60s when I was very young teenager the Walker Brothers came to Luton to The Ritz and we went up the fire escape into the Ritz where we saw them they were absolutely brilliant and handsome so handsome (the wife)
not nostalgia,Not sure about the background music on this but the vocals are definitely performed live.
nostalgia,Great song brings back memories from when I was a teenager. :)
nostalgia,50 years back music take me to my best time thanks
not nostalgia,I want to be reincarnated in parallel universe where I have that voice. It is limitlessly awesome.

nostalgia,Please take me back to the best times of my life
not nostalgia,Nice to hear a group that sounds good live as well as the studio version.
not nostalgia,"Yes, you must be the ONLY one who thinks Frankie Valli did this better than the one, the only, the ORIGINAL Walker Brothers. The Walker Brothers' ORIGINAL version is the one I hear in my mind when I think of this song. The Frankie Valli version is too slow, in my recollection."
not nostalgia,Am I the only one who thinks The Four Seasons did so much better and that this version is too fast and horrible
not nostalgia,"Love, love this song ... heard it on Supernatural and thought to myself that I need to hear it again and again. Loved it when it came out and still do, apparently."
not nostalgia,All I am anymore is a man looking  for his wife and son any one gets in the way of that is gonna lose
nostalgia,OMG I went to see them when they came to the UK and john shouted this is for that beautiful lady who is wearing the same colors as me.jees I screamed the place down.they were fantastic so was JIMMIE HENDRICKS I loved the 60s a hippy girl I was.
not nostalgia,"How interesting that todays technology means that even with this vintage, we can now easily see the downy hair on Scott's fore arms, and come to that, the tendons and veins"
nostalgia,"Love that song, what I know now wish I could go back in time ."
not nostalgia,"thanks for the info.! i didn't realize they had such sophisticated technology in the 60's. in case you're interested, the association's ""along comes mary"" is on you tube, and jim yester is singing live along with the original recording. it's the one where they appeared on the smothers brothers show...thanks again!"
not nostalgia,"very easy to do... you didn't even need to be a studio sound engineer to get only the tracks you needed. Artists used this technique frequently in the 50's, 60's and 70's whenever they weren't making appearances with a back-up band."
nostalgia,"watched ready steady go faithfully ,was totally in love with scott walker and wanted to marry him,unfortunately being 14 at the time it was not an option!! thanks for the wonderful childhood memories........"
not nostalgia,"There's so much great stuff going on musically (like the really cool Spectorish bass line, echoed on piano) that it's easy to miss what a really excellent lyric this song has. ""Emptiness...It's a place you're in...nothing to lose...but no more to win...""  Great song.  Did this one start out with the Four Seasons?"
nostalgia,This song is almost painful to listen to as it brings back so many memories of that time period that will never be again.
nostalgia,I remember when this was a hit. I was 13 and going to school dances. Great song and to a 13 year old it was so romantic and passionate.  There would be a long line of girls doing the calypso and singing to this song. What a great voice this man has.
nostalgia,Thank you. I feel nostalgic for this music very. I was a child.
nostalgia,@TheIcewitch54 I watched Ready Steady Go while in England in the 60's and loved every minute. Brings back wonderful memories of my teen years.
nostalgia,"Its my mums favorite song, its a brilliant song, remember listening to this when I was little with my mom. Great voice."
nostalgia,I remember going to their live concert at the Hemel Hempstead Pavillion - "Pop at the Pav" during summer 1996 - Brilliant ! - and this hit song was performed at top volume! Thanks for sharing - It bought back distant memories of life in the 60s! Warm Wishes - DeniseX
not nostalgia,Real nice sound. Nice voices. Nice song. Nice theme. These guys should have made it further.
nostalgia,"One of the best i grew up with,happy memories."
not nostalgia,"Most people aren't aware of this fact, but in 1966 the Walker Brothers popularity in the UK ??it particularly that of lead vocalist Scott ??it reached a new high, especially among teenage girls, and their fan club in that country was said to have been larger than The Beatles. ""The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore,"" which hit number 1 in the UK, also did well in the U.S., but was less successful, charting at number 20."
nostalgia,"Takes me right back to being at my Mums side, she would sing along to all the great songs that were on the radio back in the 60,sheer bliss"
not nostalgia,"It was originally released as a single by Frankie Valli in 1965 on the Smash label, but was more successful when recorded by The Walker Brothers in 1966.I love Frankie but he does not do this song justice I just love it by the Walker Brothers  December 2019"
nostalgia,"Hey, I got kicked out of high school in 1966 for wearing my hair that long. Time have certainly changed."
not nostalgia,A timeless powerful great song here on this day 11/29/19. .and until the end of time we will keep listening!
not nostalgia,This song was beyond their time. They had no idea that the theme was eternal.
not nostalgia,"who else is listening to this track and thinking, my father has just passed away, somehow i got here, but I am smiling, , its nearly 3 in the morning but I am sure the sun will shine in the morning,"
nostalgia,Brings back many happy memories.
nostalgia,"The BEST song for me in the 60's, high school, endless youth energies and the best era for Rock n Roll. When you're raised in these songs and bands, nothing else matters, awesome experiences. Yes, 2019, most of them are gone but their songs and music are etched in our hearts. Walker Brothers, SCOTT, JOHN, GARY- RIP"
not nostalgia,"I wholeheartedly agree with Mr. Marin.  I have about 8,000 songs in my iTunes, and this one is my favorite of all.  I can't stand most of the garbage being put out there today, so most of my music is 50's to the 80's, so ""The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore"" is in good company. But it stands alone as the very best.  Funny, but none of the trio that made their music has the surname of Walker."
not nostalgia,"An American band, made history in Britain due to The Righteous Brothers.  Walker Brothers may not have made it as famous as they did in Britain than America.  :)"
not nostalgia,"Wow, what an unforgettable, magnificently sung masterpiece of a song this is. For some reason, I always confuse the Walker Brothers with the Righteous Brothers, probably because they sound so much alike. Both groups are outstanding artistically and deserve a great deal of respect."
nostalgia,"I remember hearing this song as a 10 year old who had just found out my 16 year old crush got a girlfriend, and really feeling the lyrics were written for me!! Listening to it now, 53 years later, that same heartache came back. That's the sign of TRUE music!!! Miss those days."
nostalgia,"Sept., 2019: goosebumps and SO MANY MEMORIES attached to this song...the melodrama of being a teenager in the 60's?? can I go back??"
not nostalgia,"Listening AGAIN Sept. 28, 2019. Singing aloud in my apt. And loving every second. Three or four listens should do the trick!"
nostalgia,"so many memories attached to this song... in my teens then... the world was a big mysterious, wonderful, place... little did I know what was to come ..."
not nostalgia,"One of the great ones that rings in my head for ever, the sun is gonna shine"
not nostalgia,"I ran into this video a couple weeks ago. I'm from the 60's era of music and somehow missed this one. Fantastic song, great instruments, lyrics, and great voices. I listen to it every day now. Thanks for posting it."
not nostalgia,I love these doomsday songs - knowing it's just a song ... one of 10 of my favorite songs ever!
nostalgia,"One of the best. Now, can I go back to those days please? Life was so much simpler then.. and they had real music too."
nostalgia,I absolutely love this song. Miss those days all the time. Can never get back there again. How sad is that.
not nostalgia,"No male vocalist sounds like this today. So sad the way music has deteriorated. Listen to the clarity, the depth and timber of his voice."
nostalgia,I miss the 60`s and 70`s so much!! I really felt alive and optimistic.
not nostalgia,I have loved this song for many years. Never tire of it.I think I like it even more today. The song is definitely in my top five.
not nostalgia,One of the greatest voices in musical history. It's too bad that they didn't create more master pieces like this one for us to enjoy forever.
not nostalgia,What a voice. This song and Take it easy on yourself. These songs had real meaning .. not some crazy break up .. Drama
nostalgia,"Timeless song. One of my favorites . Brings back lovely memories, old & new "

not nostalgia,"One of those Classic (and there were so many of them) 60's songs. Era defining. Great sound, given what was available in the way  of Recording Equipment back then. Haunting, moving and beautifully crafted music."
nostalgia,Yeah! Listening to this song takes me back to my first heart broke....I thought the sun was not going to rise anymore because of the tears in my eyes...
not nostalgia,"Can today's artists write and sing a touching song like this???? Nobody! Nowadays all they sing about is lust, fame and money. The new generation sucks!"
nostalgia,This song reminds me of you WENDY. I miss you so much my big sister. I would give whatever I could to see you again.  Love and miss you so much
not nostalgia,just perfect! I listened to that song about a million times. got better each time ...
not nostalgia,MAGNIFICENT!!! This was never off our record player in the 60s! Amazing production and hidden away somewhere is some additional fantastic drummer. Try hearing it in stereo thru headphones. It blows your mind! KAN 6.19 UK . PS Thank you so much for presenting this in its correct 4:3 format!!!
not nostalgia,Best download yet....They had their own sound that no one has captured to this day......Sun has not shined since this era of music died......Beam me up Scottie........
nostalgia,"There are so many classic hits from this era and this is certainly one of them. Brilliant!!!!! vocals. I was 10 when this song cam out and I'm 63 now. So many memories, listening to this great tune."
not nostalgia,The vocals have always been overwhelmed by the orchestra...I wish the record company would create a more intelligible version.
not nostalgia,"What an irritating clip with the microphone obscuring the singers. Perhaps it was considered clever in its day. Great song, great performance despite the awful camera work."
not nostalgia,"i have no wish to detract from the brilliant sound - but such tight trousers - really>? once seen, really difficult to look elsewhere! imprinted in my mind, not in a good way."
not nostalgia,Great little song here..great vocals..i love to hear these kinds of songs its beautiful original and has such a great innocence and great feeling of pure spirted life..
not nostalgia,"One of those few perfect in every way love songs you'll never hear again because today's music doesn't compare with those of the past. One of my all-time favorite songs. Super arrangement, super voice, super harmony. Doesn't get any better than this."
nostalgia,"This is a timeless classic and I have always loved it. Reminds me of those innocent days back in early 66 when I was 9 years old.This was playing on the juke box in the Blind Beggar, Whitechapel when Ronnie Kray shot George Cornell straight through the forehead while he was sat at the bar in March 66 killing him almost outright."
nostalgia,My grandchild called this song crap  !!!!!!! ..This song brings back so many memories for me .. brought tears to my eyes ..
not nostalgia,Masculine melancholy given full throttle by the brilliant Scott Engel.  One of the great pop ballads of the mid 60s.
nostalgia,Brought back some crazy memories. Thank you for my teen years. Played this non stop.
nostalgia,I had the audio cassette as a child. First rap tape. I was listening to this song.
not nostalgia,watch out pretty Ricky they were here before you were and I thank you for keeping it going.

nostalgia,Takes me way back ..  best years of my life music wise
nostalgia,Club was jumping back in the day when this song came on. Good old days

nostalgia,Brings Back Memories  Days In The Club In The 80's
not nostalgia,I can honestly say South Florida bass music  had the whole south on lock back in the mid 80's through the early 90's. This is one those  classics out so many from that era!!!!!
not nostalgia,"This song fits any situation an fits any type of party, cookout, anything. This is the greatest song of all time, there will be no other song seemed out as much are listen to as muchm as this one. All genders, an races will agree. Every generation of ya family will tell you the same if you ask them. Now "" hey !!"" ""let that thank play"""
not nostalgia,"It's like this voice and beat were made to coincide. "" I need you , sha na na na , you know what I want"" music has lost it purpose . To innovate,  motivate, inspire not degrade,  diss or downgrade."
nostalgia,"Oh, cool man I miss the 1980s, but don't the one little guy look like lil  Wayne??"
nostalgia,This song just take me back. How great the 80s was
nostalgia,Damn I wish I could go back to these days.
not nostalgia,To all this is when men where men  and we told our women how we felt. But try that now your called soft why because we love you.
nostalgia,MAN TAKE ME BACK TO THE 90'S.!!!!! this new 2000s generation not for me.!! me & my fiance was just dancing all on the dance floor to this last night.. boy do I miss the 90s.

nostalgia,More than I can say.. Miss everything from 70's....
nostalgia,Brings back memories of my childhood back in the 80's. They were the best of times...
nostalgia,My dad used to bath us in the 70s. We were all real little and he  sing this to my mom while he was bathing us. Precious Memories. 
nostalgia,"Reminds me of being a little girl, listening to this with my parents. Love it"
not nostalgia,"I love this song, it is a classic, and there is no other that is exactly like it, nor will it age, so whatever dumb comments others may say, it just means they don't have LOVE in their life.  So, from me to you, I love you more than I can say, and twice as much tomorrow."
not nostalgia,"This man had more natural talent then all of today pop tarts and wailing ball less dudes on the radio......I can only imagine the masterpieces he would have written today had he not passed at such a young age, many more great songs by Leo await you, listen to them all."
not nostalgia,"There is something really special to that era, not those HD graphics, no enchanced music just simplistic and real yet amazing."
not nostalgia,That pretty much is what happens when I paint too.  I end up just wearing paint.
not nostalgia,The guy has cute smile... and yes we all came here after listening to sweet GRANDMA and that AMAZING street singer
not nostalgia,"Twitter is such a powerful media source!! The amount of people here, myself included, after seeing the sweet video of the lady singing with her dog is unbelievable!! "

nostalgia,Really hard song for me to listen to.  I used to sing this with my now deceased mother in the car in 80s.  She knew it was my favorite at the time and used to turn it up and we'd sing it to each other.  She was getting something out of me that I usually didn't give her because I didn't really know what love was at 8.
nostalgia,"I had forgotten this song even existed until I saw the lovely old lady and her cat serenading her sweet little doggo. I was 4 years old when this song came out in 1980. It gives me such warm, early childhood nostalgia. Brings me right back. Feels like yesterday. That lady was probably about my age, now (40-ish) when this song first came out. In the blink of an eye I'll be her age now, if I'm lucky enough to live that long."
nostalgia,I love you more than I can say. It's the words to the song .that makes it a big hit. Brings back so many memories.
not nostalgia,"I find this song so soothing, this is the first time I've seen the video, I prefer the song in a different format"
nostalgia,I really miss the old day :(
not nostalgia,What a beauty   How beautiful is this message delivered from the bottom of the heart. I love you twice as much tomorrow...... what a great word. Unfortunately youngsters of today will never be able to measure the weight of this song.

not nostalgia,"Imagine driving a car through the California desert roadway with the warm sunset, listening to this song would be the GOLDEN moment."
not nostalgia,"Dear sir i really like you're song and i want too use you are song my short film,but i want you are permission"
nostalgia,"another great song , it makes me miss the past , the world today is garbage"

nostalgia,"Brings back memories... summer of '82, 14 years old, falling in love with a 14 year old girl, listening to this song and feeling exactly like that ;) Long walks hand in hand, a first kiss on the shores of Danube... all tied to this song."

nostalgia,Remind me my childhood....
nostalgia,wow..LEO SAYER songs are ever green for me..remember i loved to play his tracks before leaving for school every single day. Gives me a fresh feeling
not nostalgia,Love is the gift that keeps on giving. Love someone and they will know how to love someone else and on it goes.
not nostalgia,If you can't dance physically you can dance in your mind so keep on dancing  friends!

nostalgia,i remember my high school&my girl friend in  1998

not nostalgia,One of only a couple dozen songs from the 80's or later that can pull me away from my golden oldies and other Adult Standards. A simple message and melody made complete by outstanding orchestration and arranging.
not nostalgia,One day they may countrify this song. Of course it will never be as nice as this version.

not nostalgia,I don't understand how someone could dislike this song! This is such a beautiful song it hits right at home.
nostalgia,Classic alright ....brings back so many memories mate .... thank you !!
not nostalgia,Beautiful lyrics and excellent voice. It was far more real singing than the modern music in which singers rely on digital devices to produce better versions.
nostalgia,"Love the song, brings me back to a better place in my life. I miss all of the music from the 50's , 60's, 70's and 80's. Music that you could understand the words to the songs being sung. The songs touched all of the feelings you had inside when you hear these older songs on the radio."

not nostalgia,"He really has that ""love you like a brother"" look about him. That safe, let me tell about all my boyfriends, I'm gonna use you as a doormat sort of look. Good song though. It was one of my favorites around 1980."
not nostalgia,"That's funny. But Leo really is a nice guy. He started out singing in hospitals as a clown for sick kids. Not that most people would care. But nonetheless, at least he thinks of others."

I still love it today and, as many others who have commented, there has never been anyone to emulate Elvis in his presentation, voice and presence. He really was gifted."
nostalgia,This is the first CD I bought after my marriage ended in divorce after 28 years. I remember driving in my car turning this song up very loud had car the windows rolled down crying. 21 years later I still love this song
